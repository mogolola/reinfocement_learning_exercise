# Preliminaries

For all practicals, we will make heavy use of python and many of its
libraries. To have access to the full power of python, virtual environments
and the command line, it is recommended to have access to a Unix system, an
emulated terminal (Windows 10 gives you access to such a terminal), or a
Virtual Machine.

Besides, we advice you to use conda to manage the various requirements that may change from one practical to the other. Conda can be installed following this link. Install the latest python 3 version of conda. Once conda is installed, before working on a practical, you  should create a new conda environment. For example for the first practical,  execute conda create -n practical1. You can then access your new environment  using source activate practical1. Each of the practical provides you with a requirements.txt file. You can install all the necessary requirements by  running '''pip install -r requirements.txt''' in your virtual environment.

# Practical 4

This practical corresponds to the one given at Centrale last year, made by Guillaume Charpiat and Corentin Tallec -as the practical are shared between Centrale and M2 AIC-. You will find the subject in the .pdf file in the git, and two files : one is the definition of the famous mountain car problem and the other is the file used for testing and implementing your agents.
